# Biography

Dr. Chubaty is an ecologist and simulation modeller developing landscape-level models of insect dispersal and forest disturbance.

His research broadly explores the impacts of host selection and dispersal at multiple spatial scales as well as scaling up from individual-based behavioural models to population-, community-, and even landscape-level models of insect outbreak and disturbance.
