I came across this incredibly useful site today:

[http://csleditor.quist.de/csleditor/show/1/example-citation-style](http://csleditor.quist.de/csleditor/show/1/example-citation-style)

No longer need to manually edit custom citation style (CSL) files for Mendeley (and Zotero) within a text file!!!
