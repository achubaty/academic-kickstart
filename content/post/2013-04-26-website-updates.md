I just transferred my hosting away from GoDaddy (good riddance!) and am now self-hosting this site on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

There may be some DNS and 404 hiccups for the next 48 hours or so while all the new settings "take". Please update your bookmarks accordingly, and thank you for you patience.
