# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "My doctoral work involved the development of analytical and simulation models of mountain pine beetle (MPB) habitat selection and dispersal behaviour, and the resulting population distributions and dynamics. Specifically, I considered the role of energy- and time-limited host search in MPB, and I developed individual-based state-dependent dynamic game models of beetle host selection."
