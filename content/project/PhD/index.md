title: "PhD thesis: Individual host selection decisions and population-level responses in a time- and energy-limited forager, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins"
date: 2013-09-26T13:37:16-06:00

summary: "My doctoral work involved the development of analytical and simulation models of mountain pine beetle (MPB) habitat selection and dispersal behaviour, and the resulting population distributions and dynamics. Specifically, I considered the role of energy- and time-limited host search in MPB, and I developed individual-based state-dependent dynamic game models of beetle host selection."
