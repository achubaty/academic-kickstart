Working with others in the McIntire lab at the Pacific Forestry Centre, we are working on integrating various simulation models dealing with forest vegetaiton dynamics, fire, insect disturbance, and wildlife populations, to inform decision making in these management areas.

We are developing multiple simulation model components for use with the [`SpaDES`](http://predictiveecology.org/) simulation platform (of which I am co-developer).
