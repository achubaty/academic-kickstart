title: "LandWeb: historic range of variation in western boreal forests"
date: 2018-04-13T20:37:16-06:00

summary: "LandWeb is the first large scale, data-driven approach to simulating historic natural ranges of variation (H/NRV). This model integrates two well-used models for forest stand succession and fire simulation, and is implemented using the `SpaDES` platform."

LandWeb was initially developed with Eliot McIntire's group at the Pacific Forestry Centre and with funding contributions through [fRI Research](https://friresearch.ca/project/landweb-simulation-modelling).

A summary of the results is available at [landweb.ca](http://landweb.ca).

Ongoing work explores model dynamics, sensitivity, and further refinements.
