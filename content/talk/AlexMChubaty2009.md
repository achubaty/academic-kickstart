abstract = "Individual variation in energy reserves and timing of emergence are expected to constrain host selection decisions of mountain pine beetle. We examined the timing and condition of emerging beetles, describing the probability of emerging on a particular day with a particular condition, which can be used in models of individual host selection and attack."
