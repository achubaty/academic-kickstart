abstract = "Reproduction in Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is contingent upon successful search for and colonization of suitable host trees. Field data, collected from a 1.42 ha lodgepole pine stand, are examined to determine the availability of host trees, and will be used to parameterize a model of beetle host-acceptance."
